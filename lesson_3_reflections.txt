When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  The simple answer is, it could act as a backup if I lose my work on a local machine.
  Other uses include that I could work from some other machine (like my home-pc) to do changes.
  But the most important I guess is collaboration among various folks working on the same project.
  By having a centralised repo on github, it would be easy to get changes of my peers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  The same reason u dont want remote to be updated whatever is there in local.
  Probably there are changes which u have in remote for some purpose but not
  useful or not needed. So if we let git decide it, these unnecessary changes
  will clutter our repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
  Fork  - Cloning a repo from github to github
  Clone - Copying a repo from github to local
  Branch - Creating a label which will follow another line of commits in a
           repo
  I would use fork when I want to work on a project started by some other
  person and add my changes to it and proabably collaborate with some other
  folks. Even if I am working alone, I would not clone instead bcoz if I want
  to have another remote - different from where I cloned it would be to push
  my changes - I need not create another repo on github and push. Though one
  could do that as Sarah said - by forking we can give due credit to
  prinicipal owner of the project.

  Branching is not related to fork/clone, it something I would do when I want
  to work on a new or experimental feature or a bug fix - I mean something
  which wont clutter my master - which is the current working version of my repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
  First thing come into mind is that we can run "git status" and "git log"
  command without any internet connection which can be very helpful to know
  about remote status when we are in a "remote" area(pun intended).
  Second while pulling the changes it becomes easy where to add the stuff.
  Like if it is an out-of-order state, we don't lose the commit which is done
  by us not pushed and we can distinguish what is extra there from remote
  which is then merged.
  Third we could have fast-forward merges. Although it could be done without
  it, it is a nice way.
