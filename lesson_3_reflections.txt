When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  The simple answer is, it could act as a backup if I lose my work on a local machine.
  Other uses include that I could work from some other machine (like my home-pc) to do changes.
  But the most important I guess is collaboration among various folks working on the same project.
  By having a centralised repo on github, it would be easy to get changes of my peers.
