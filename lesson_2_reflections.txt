What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  Git creates a hidden directory named ".git". It contains meta-data about my
  repo. It is needed to create the required-info which git needs to maintain
  for tracking the files, commits etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
  Staging-area is kind of middle-ground b/w working directory and repository.
  It contains the changes that has to be added to repo but not yet commited.
  There may be some changes which are present in working directory but we do
  not wish to commit yet or do it in next commit as there are multiple logical
  changes being done. So it helps us in giving control of which files to commit,
  so that we can do one logical change per commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
  Just add only those files which represents one logical change. Then u can go
  ahead and commit it. U can do repeatedly for all the changes.
